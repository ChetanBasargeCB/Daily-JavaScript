    <h1>JavaScript OOPS</h1>
    <h1>Class in OOPS</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> Class is a program template that provides data and logic. </li>
        <li>It enables separation and code reusability. </li>
        <li>Class is considered as an “Entity” when it is mapping to business requirements.</li>
        <li>Class is considered as a “Model” when it is representing data requirements.</li> <br>

        <h2>Class Members</h2>
        <p>Class member can be any one of the following</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Property</li>
            <li> Accessor </li>
            <li>Method</li>
            <li>Consturctor</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <h2>1. Class Property</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A property is responsible for handling data in class.</li>
            <li>You can configure any type of data into property</li>
            <li>You can access within or outside class.</li>
            <h2> Static in Property</h2>
            <li> JavaScript ES6+ version can make a property as static. </li>
            <li>Static refers to continuous memory.</li>
            <li> It is good for handling continuous operations. </li>
            <li>A static member is accessible within or outside class by using class name.</li>
            <h2>Dynamic/ Non Static</h2>
            <li>All other members in class are by default “non-static” or dynamic. </li>
            <li>Dynamic refers to “discreet memory”. </li>
            <li>It is good for handling disconnected operations. </li>
            <li> Non Static members are accessible within class by using “this” keyword and outside class by using instance of class. [object]</li>
        </ul>

          <h2>2.Accessor</h2>
          <li>Accessors are used to have fine grained control over the property.</li>
          <li>They are used for handling read and write operations on a property.</li>
          <li> They are classified into 2 types</li>
          <ol>
            <li> get - getter</li>
            <li>Set - setter</li>
          </ol>
          <li>“Getter” is used to read and return value of a property.</li>
          <li> “Setter” is used to assign a new value into property. </li>
    </ul>
